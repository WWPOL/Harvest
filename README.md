# PROJECT: GREEDY BEETLE (aka Harvest)
Discord bot to fetch torrents

Currently thinking of this as a 2 part project, one is the discord bot that handles the commands and notifications and the other will be a plugin to a torrent client (thinking Deluge for now) that kicks off downloads and tells the bot to respond to in Discord.
