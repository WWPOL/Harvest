## Features

## Beginner Developers

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot(I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy. With Discordeno, I tried to build it in a way that solved all the headaches I had when first starting out coding bots. If you are a beginner developer, please use this boilerplate.

**Modular commands, arguments, events, inhibitors, monitors, tasks.**

- Clean and powerful commands system
  - Powerful argument handling including validating, parsing and modifications.
  - Easily create custom arguments for your specific needs.
  - Command aliases.
  - Cooldowns and allowed uses before cooldown triggers.
  - Author and bot permission checks in server AND in channel!
- Clean and powerful events system
  - Simple functions that are called when an event occurs.
  - Easily reloadable!
  - No possible memory leaks due to incorrect EventEmitter usage!
  - Useful events available to help debug!
- Clean and powerful inhibitors system
