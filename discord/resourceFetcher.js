/**
 * <pre>
 * Fetches a resource and download it onto the server.
 * The download process of each resource is a state machine implemented by this class. The
 * state machine's state for each resource is stored in MongoDB in the `requests` 
 * collection. The state machine is driven by repeatedly calling the download() method.
 * Note that the download method has to be called for each resource. Calling download() on
 * resources which have reached a terminal state will not break anything but it causes
 * unnecessary computation. The .torrent.status.inProgress field indicates if the 
 * download() method still needs to be called for a resource. Once a resource reaches a
 * terminal state download() will set this field to false. The updateAll() method 
 * automatically calls download() on only resources who need it. There is no state field
 * which explicitly marks what state a resource is in. Instead preconditions are implmented
 * in download() in a way which results in these distinct states.
 *
 * The states and their transitions are roughly:
 *
 * Initial state: ASKING_USER
 * Terminal states: SEEDING, FAILED
 *
 * ASKING_USER:
 *   Description: The bot has found search results for a user and is waiting for the user
 *                to select a choice. At this point the ResourceFetcher doesn't do anything
 *                and just exits, since the user hasn't told us what to download yet.
 *   Guaranteed state fields: .discord (all subfields), results
 *   Transitions:
 *     -> SELECTED if the user selects a choice of what to download.
 *
 * SELECTED:
 *   Description: The bot has recorded a user's choice from Discord but the download 
 *                process has not been started
 *   Guaranteed state fields: all from ASKING_USER + .choice
 *   Transitions:
 *     -> DOWNLOADING as soon as the SELECTED state is reached the download process is
 *          started and this state is transitioned to.
 *
 * DOWNLOADING:
 *   Description: Transmission is downloading a resource.
 *   Guaranteed state fields: all from SELECTED + .torrent
 *   Transitions:
 *     -> SEEDING if the download successfully finishes
 *     -> FAILED if an error occurs with the download
 *
 * SEEDING:
 *   Description: After a download succeeeds Transmission will begin seeding
 *   Gaurenteed state fields: all from SELECTED
 *   Transitions: none, this state is terminal
 * 
 * FAILED:
 *   Description: After a resource cannot be downloaded using Transmission
 *   Guaranteed state fields: all from SELECTED + .error
 *   Transitions: none, this state is terminal
